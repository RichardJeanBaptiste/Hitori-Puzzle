# Hitori-Puzzle

Hitori is a Japanese logic puzzle based on a grid of numbers. Each number is either circled or blocked. The rules are

  - Blocks cannot connect horizontally or vertically.
  - The same number cannot be circled more than once in any row or column.
  - Circles must form a single path connected horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally.
